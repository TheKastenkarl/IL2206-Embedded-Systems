# IL2206 Embedded Systems
Repository for laboratories of the course [IL2206 Embedded Systems](https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/IL2206?l=en) in the winter semester 2022/2023 at KTH Stockholm.
The course covers both the hardware and software of embedded computer systems, with a focus on embedded realtime systems.

## Laboratory 1 : Concurrent and Real-Time Software Development in Ada
Application of communication mechanisms (like semaphores and rendezvous) and concurrency and real-time features of Ada. Here is a screenshot of an implemented rate-monotonic schedule with four tasks:
